# Getting Started

Here are the commands you can use to get started:

Install all the libraries first:

```
brew install nvm
nvm install 8.9.4
brew install yarn
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --auto-dotfiles --autolibs=enable --rails
brew install postgresql
brew install redis
brew install elasticsearch
brew install heroku/brew/heroku

# use homebrew services to start elasticsearch and redis in the background
brew services start redis
brew services start elasticsearch
```

Clone the app and install the gems:

```
git clone <clone URL>
cd shape/
rvm install ruby 2.4.3
cd ..
cd shape/
gem install bundler
bundle install
yarn install

# Initialize and update the git submodule for Network React Components
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Setup the `.env` file with valid credentials:

```
cp .env.example .env
# modify credentials
```

Create the database and migrate:

```
rails db:setup

# get access to Shell commands in Terminal
source ./shell-commands

# copy production data to your local database
shapecopydb local
```

Run tests:

Rails Unit & Controller Tests

```
# run rails tests once:
bin/rspec
# watch files and re-run tests:
bundle exec guard
```

Jest Unit Tests

```
# run JS tests once:
yarn run jest
# watch files and re-run JS tests:
yarn test
```

Cypress Integration Tests

Note: Make sure to select **Electron** as your browser in the cypress dropdown when running it locally.

```
# Run cypress integration tests:
yarn cypress-ci

# Or control the tests:
yarn cypress
```

## Running your dev environment

1. Run your webpack server:

```
heroku local webpack -f Procfile.development
```

2. Run your sidekiq worker:

```
heroku local worker -f Procfile.development
```

3. Run your rails server:

```
rails s
```

### (Optional) Use ttab for quick dev environment setup

Install ttab and [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install):

```
npm install -g ttab
```

Run dev script:

```
./dev.sh
```

This will open separate tabs to:

1. Run the webpack dev server and sidekiq worker
1. Run the rails server
1. Open [Atom](https://atom.io/) in the project directory
   And will open your browser (may need to refresh page after initial webpack)

```

```
