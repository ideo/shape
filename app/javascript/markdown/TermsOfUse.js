[**Back to top**](#top)


## 3. Payment

Access to certain parts of the Sites (for example, the Dashboard) requires you to pay fees. **The fees for Creative Difference and Shape are set forth below. Please read them carefully.** Please note, if you are an enterprise customer using Shape or Creative Difference through an authorized third party reseller, your payment obligations will be as set forth in your agreement with such reseller.  If you are an enterprise customer contracting directly with IDEO, your payment obligations may differ from the below and if so shall be set forth in the Services Agreement or order form between you and IDEO. **Please note that your use of Shape may be subject to caps on the amount of data you can use.  Any caps on data for your Shape account will be set forth on the billing page or for enterprise customers in the Services Agreement or order form between you and IDEO.**

**Creative Difference Payment Terms:**

Access to the Dashboard and ordering an Assessment for your team requires you to pay fees (“**Fees**”). Before You pay any Fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the Fees that You will be charged. All Fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable. If you do not accept the Fees IDEO may discontinue providing the Assessment to you. By paying for and accessing Creative Difference, you, or a certain number of users from your organization, may be granted access to the Shape Platform without additional fees.

Following registration of an account, you are committed to an initial access period of one (1) year (“**Initial Access Period**”) and your credit card on file will be charged by our third party payment processor on a monthly basis from the date of signup until the end of the Initial Access Period, after which you may cancel your access to the Assessment. For clarity, you will pay for a minimum of 5 team members (“**Minimum Users**”) on a monthly basis even if no team members take the Assessment. For each additional team member who takes the Assessment above the Minimum Users (“**Additional User(s)**”), you will pay the Fee for Additional Users stated on the payment page at the end of each month starting from the date when the Additional User takes the Assessment until 12 months from the date they last take that Assessment, unless you terminate your account earlier in accordance with these Terms.

The “**Ongoing Access Period**” is any period of access to the Assessment beyond the Initial Access Period.

For clarity, by accepting this TOU, you will be charged:



*   A minimum Fee of $750 (broken down into 12 monthly payments of $62.50 each) for the Minimum Users during the Initial Access Period; and (b) a minimum Fee of $62.50 per month for the Minimum Users during the Ongoing Access Period.
*   Depending on how many Additional Users you have, you may be charged per Additional User on a monthly basis until that Additional User ceases to be active 12 months from when they last take the Assessment. Total monthly price will vary according to the number of total users and when they take the Assessment.

As a “**Team Leader**” (i.e., the person who is setting up the account), you can issue the Assessment to the team members you choose up to the maximum amount of team members set for your account.  If you wish to increase the maximum amount of team members allowed by your account, please go to the billing page in your account and click “Add Team Members.” Once a team member takes the Assessment, they may retake that Assessment at any time.

IDEO may change the Fees charged for the Assessment or other services offered on the Sites at any time, provided that the change will become effective only at the end of the then-current month of your access. IDEO will provide you with reasonable prior written notice of any change in fees in order to give you an opportunity to cancel your account before the change becomes effective.

You will be responsible for all taxes and other governmental charges of any kind (except for taxes based on IDEO’s net income) that may be imposed on the Fees.

Please take a look at our various payment examples below for more information on the Initial Access Period and Ongoing Access Period payments.



---


**EXAMPLES**

**Scenario 1: 5 (or fewer) team members take the Assessment **



*   Initial Access Period:  Team Leader pays $62.50/month for the 12 month period.  Total paid during Initial Access Period = $750
*   Ongoing Access Period:  If Team Leader does not cancel their account after the Initial Access Period, then up to 5 team members may take the Assessment and Team Leader is charged $62.50/month until they cancel.

**Scenario 2: More than 5 team members take the Assessment**



*   Initial Access Period:  If ten (10) team members take the Assessment several times during the Initial Access Period starting in month one, and all 10 team members take the Assessment for a final time in month 6, then the organization pays $125 every month from month 1 until the anniversary of month 6. Total paid during Initial Access Period for 10 team members: $125 x 12 = $1500
*   Ongoing Access Period:  If Team Leader does not cancel their account after the Initial Access Period, total paid in first six months of year 2 for all 10 team members: $125 x 6 = $750.  Total paid in second half of year 2 for Minimum Users: $62.50 x 6 = $375.

**Scenario 3: Team members take Assessment at different times of the year.**



*   Initial Access Period:  No team members respond to the Assessment for the first 6 months; Ten (10) team members take the Assessment in month 6 for the first time and never take it again; six (6) additional team members take the Assessment for the first time in month 7 and several other times, taking the Assessment for the final time in month 12.
*   The organization pays as follows:
    *   $62.50 per month to cover the Minimum Users for months 1-6 = $375.00
    *   ($12.50 x 10) to cover all Users in month 7 = $125.00
    *   ($12.50 x 16) per month to cover all Users for months 8-12 = $1000.
*   Total paid during Initial Access Period = $1,500.00
*   Ongoing Access Period:  Unless Team Leader cancels access after the Initial Access Period, the organization will pay the following:
    *   ($12.50 x 16) to cover all Users for months 1-6 = $1200
    *   ($12.50 x 6) to cover Users whose last Assessment was on month 12 during Initial Access Period for months 6-12 = $75

**Shape Payment Terms:**

**Free Trials**. Where you signed yourself or other Users up as part of a free trial, You will not be charged: (a) until your free trial period expires in accordance with the applicable offer you redeem on the billing page; b) unless you exceed the number of Users who may benefit from the applicable offer, after/in excess of which you will be charged automatically on an ongoing basis in accordance with the following section:

**Subscription Payment Terms. **Your first payment shall be made on the first day of the month after you exceed the number of free users stated on the marketing or billing page (as applicable), at the monthly price per Active User stated at checkout on the billing page, and shall continue in monthly rolling payments on an ongoing basis thereafter, until you choose to cancel. “**Active User**” means a person who accesses and views the Shape Platform within a 3 month period. If a user has accessed the instance but then takes no action and does not view Shape for 3 months, they become inactive and you will no longer be charged for them. Charges related to Active Users will be calculated on a prorated basis in their first month depending on when they join. So, if e.g 5 Users join 8 days from the end of a 30-day month, on the first day of the following month, you will pay the monthly price listed on [Shape.space](https://www.shape.space/) x (8/30) x 5 for those 5 Users and full price for the following full months. **IDEO shall collect these payments every month using the credit card or bank account details provided to IDEO at checkout for the first payment. You can cancel any time and, upon cancellation, your subscription will terminate at the end of that current billing cycle. **This means that if You took out Your subscription on March 1, and cancel 15 days into the billing cycle e.g on March 15, your cancellation will take effect on March 30. The minimum purchase period is one month. **You can cancel by amending your billing settings on the billing page and unsubscribing.**

Payment for other Shape features such as the Feedback Survey or other features or services shall be payable immediately following your confirmation of the order using the account details provided on setup. The cost of such payments shall be as displayed prior to the acceptance page.

This TOU, and the Privacy & Cookie Policy constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between IDEO and you relating to use of the Site, and supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between IDEO and you regarding the same. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this TOU invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be deemed omitted and the other provisions of this TOU will remain in full force and effect. IN THE EVENT THE SHAPE PLATFORM OR CREATIVE DIFFERENCE ASSESSMENT  IS BEING USED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH AN IDEO CONSULTING PROJECT, THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO THE IDEO SERVICES AGREEMENT AND STATEMENT OF WORK BETWEEN YOU OR THE APPLICABLE CLIENT AND IDEO, AND ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN THESE TERMS AND THAT SERVICE AGREEMENT SHALL BE RESOLVED IN FAVOR OF THAT SERVICE AGREEMENT.

You may not assign or transfer this TOU, by operation of law or otherwise, without IDEO’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer this TOU, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. IDEO may freely assign or transfer this TOU without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, this TOU will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

Any notices or other communications provided by IDEO under this TOU, including those regarding modifications to this TOU, will be given: (i) by IDEO via email; or (ii) by posting to the Sites. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

We strongly suggest you read our Privacy Policy to learn more about your choices regarding our electronic communications practice and other uses of your personal data.

IDEO’s failure to enforce any right or provision of this TOU will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of IDEO. Except as expressly set forth in this TOU, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this TOU will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this TOU or otherwise.
